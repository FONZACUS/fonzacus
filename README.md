# WIP
scraping up what little left before its gone (TM) (R) (C)

## NAVIGATION
[HOME](/) [LISTS](/lists)

### NOTE
you should have a good rss reader to also be able to scrape sites that dont have feeds. a good alternative would be site based personal homepages[^1] like feedly[^2] or my current favorite protopage[^3]

doesnt require a login for a basic template, and you can also view others personal pages without logging in. heres mines[^4] for another example

###### SAMPLE[^9]
```
<opml version="2.0"><head><title>

</title></head><body>

<outline text="topic">
<outline type="rss" text="item" xmlUrl="link"/>
</outline>

</body></opml>
```
